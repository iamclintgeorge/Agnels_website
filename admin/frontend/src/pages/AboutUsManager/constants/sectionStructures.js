Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology has established itself as an exemplary centre of quality education, leading to the holistic development of it's learners.\n\nIt's truly heartening to note that FCRIT, in all its educational initiatives and teaching-learning programmes, in conformity with New Education Policy-2020 insights and recommendations, is effectively moving towards multidisciplinary and holistic education, promotion of quality research and institutional autonomy.\n\nThe institute has taken care in consistently maintaining high academic standards, across all areas of teaching and learning. It has also been able to create and maintain a safe and equitable learning environment, while ensuring the mental well-being of all its students.\n\nIn its constant endeavour to equip the learners to the swiftly evolving demands of industries and their modern challenges, as well as to promote their industry readiness and their employability skills, the institution has sharply focused on developing the soft skills of its students, like communication skills, creative and critical thinking, initiatives and self-direction, leadership and responsibility; collaboration as well as social and cross-cultural interaction skills.\n\nBlissfully, FCRIT has embraced diversity, equity and inclusivity into it's culture with highest regard for all, and thus creating a sense of belongingness, values and meaningfulness in the life of all its students, faculty and staff.\n\nContentedly and with a joyful heart, I would like to mention here, that hundreds of our alumni today are talented and accomplished professionals and successful entrepreneurs in various fields of business activities. Our alumni in the truest sense are serving as powerful ambassadors for their alma mater.\n\nGiven the commitment of its faculty and their expertise in empowering all their students, and the consistent academic excellence achieved year after year, I'm sure that FCRIT shall continue to maintain its high standards and its effective and meaningful collaboration with communities and industries as well as face all future challenges with poise and courage.\n\nWishing you all Godspeed.",
